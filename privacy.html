Welcome to Remi. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application.
Data Collection
Remi is designed to be privacy-first.
Personal Information: We do not collect, store, or share your name, email address, phone number, or precise location data.
User Content: Your prompts and generated images are processed securely to provide the service. They are stored locally on your device. We do not use your private generations to train public models without your explicit consent.
Usage Data: We may collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable usage data (such as app crash reports or feature usage statistics) solely to improve the performance and stability of the app.
Third-Party Services
Remi may use third-party API providers for image generation. These providers receive your text prompts to generate the requested images but do not have access to your personal identity.
Data Security
We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data during transmission. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.
Children's Privacy
Remi is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
